Hello, this is Alvin!

I consider myself a classically trained programmer.  Languages include C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, and HTML.  

I have some familiarity with Visual Studio, 3DS Max, Maya, PhotoShop, PaintShop, Premiere, Unity, and Unreal.  

I also am a part of a Renaissance Faire combat re-enactment group, so I have some history and actual crafting and stage fighting experience with medieval weapons and armor.

What else would you all want to know about me??
